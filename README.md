# mms_shockstat

Some tools to do plot overviews and do very simple statistics on bow shock crossings by MMS.

All events are listed in shock_list.txt. Some of the events are foreshock events like SLAMS. Upstream events disconnected from the bow shock, like solar wind CSs and IP shocks should not be included. Also events with unstable thBn, like HFAs, should be excluded. These events are collected in notshock_list.txt.
